# Messenger Lowkey
Check messenger without the stress. Don't send typing indicators or read receipts.

- 🤫 Don't show people you've read their message or when you're typing
- ❤️ We're firm believers in data privacy and don't collect or share any data.
- 💻 Free and open source. Only thirty lines of code, and easy to install yourself.

##### Before 😭
You have messages but don't check them, leading to long response times

##### After 🥰
Read and reply to messages as soon as you get them without pressure

### 👋 Texting should be relaxed
Read receipts and typing indicators optimize for engagement, not comfort. By making your actions more private, we make it easier to read and respond.
