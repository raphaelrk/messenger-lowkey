# Messenger Lowkey
Check messenger without the stress. Don't send typing indicators or read receipts.

Made because I think checking messenger is super stressful, partly because it tells people as you read their messages. So I just wind up not even clicking into people's messages. I think this could help me get back to people more, and maybe others will like it, too.
